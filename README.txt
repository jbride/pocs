overview
  - hodge-podge of small, stand-alone java middleware proof-of-concepts

set-up:
  - these POCs are built using maven and ant
  - you'll need to supplement your existing maven repo with a repo specific for JBoss EAP6.*
  - the example base/src/main/resources/settings.xml can be used to get you started.
  - further maven set-up instructions are found at the top of that config file
